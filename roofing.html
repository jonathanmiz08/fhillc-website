                        Our shingle roofing services focus on delivering durable and high-quality results using top-grade
                        materials. We primarily work with GAF shingles, known for their reliability and longevity, but we
                        are happy to accommodate different brands upon customer request. Our comprehensive process for replacing
                        old roofs includes a full rip-off of existing shingles, followed by the replacement of any weakened or
                        damaged plywood to reinforce the roof’s structure. For both new and existing roofs, we install high-quality
                        underlayment paper, as well as ice and water shield along roof edges and valleys for enhanced weather protection,
                        creating a durable and weather-resistant barrier beneath the new roof shingles. Our team is also skilled in
                        replacing chimney flashing and pipe boots, and performing necessary repairs to ensure a seamless fit that prevents
                        leaks and extends the life of your roof. If you’re looking for a new roof or need repairs to keep your home
                        secure and well-protected for the next 30 years, we are here to help. Contact Family Home Improvement LLC today for a reliable and
                        professional roofing service that prioritizes your home’s safety and value.
