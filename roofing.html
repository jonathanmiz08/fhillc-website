                Our shingle roofing services focus on delivering durable and high-quality results using top-grade
                materials. We primarily work with GAF shingles, known for their reliability and longevity, but we
                are happy to accommodate different brands upon customer request. Our comprehensive process for replacing
                old roofs includes a full rip-off of existing shingles, followed by the replacement of any weakened or
                damaged plywood to reinforce the roof’s structure. For both new and existing roofs, we install high-quality
                underlayment paper, as well as ice and water shield along roof edges and valleys for enhanced weather protection,
                creating a durable and weather-resistant barrier beneath the new roof shingles. Our team is also skilled in
                replacing chimney flashing and pipe boots, and performing necessary repairs to ensure a seamless fit that prevents
                leaks and extends the life of your roof. If you’re looking for a new roof or need repairs to keep your home
                secure and well-protected for the next 30 years, we are here to help. Contact Family Home Improvement LLC today for a reliable and
                professional roofing service that prioritizes your home’s safety and value.

                We offer comprehensive flat roofing services, including repairs, new installations, and rip-off and
                install projects, along with plywood replacement when needed. A high-quality flat roof installation
                is essential for effective water drainage, heat management, and overall durability, making it a crucial
                investment for your property. Properly installed flat roofs can prevent pooling water and reduce the risk
                of leaks, extending the lifespan of your roof. Our team ensures precise installation using top-grade materials, so you can
                trust us to deliver a flat roof that not only meets your needs but also stands the test of time.
